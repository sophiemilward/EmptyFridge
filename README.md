Empty Fridge app
This app allows users to search for recipes based on a single ingredient.  
It uses Edamam API to provide a list of possible recipes, and a movie recommendation to go with the meal.
It stores the list of recipes in a CSV file.
It asks the user to choose one of the recipes, and then saves those ingredients in a .txt file shopping list.
This app is programmed in Python.
